# Simple Python Calculator �

This is a basic Python calculator that performs arithmetic operations on two user-input numbers.

## Features ✨

- Takes two numbers as input (supports decimals)
- Performs four fundamental operations:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗
- Displays all results in a clean format

## How to Use 🚀

1. Run the Python script
2. Enter the first number when prompted
3. Enter the second number when prompted
4. View the calculated results for:
   - Sum of the numbers
   - Difference between the numbers
   - Product of the numbers
   - Quotient of the numbers

## Example Usage 💻

```
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
```

## Important Notes ⚠️

- This program does not handle division by zero errors (entering 0 as the second number will crash the program)
- Only works with numeric inputs (entering text will cause an error)

## Requirements 📋

- Python 3.x

## Future Improvements 🔮

- Add error handling for non-numeric inputs
- Implement division by zero protection
- Add more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.)
- Create a GUI interface

Happy calculating! 🎉
